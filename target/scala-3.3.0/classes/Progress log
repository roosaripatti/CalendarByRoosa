Questions
- Instructions state "Voit käyttää eri värisävyjä osoittamaan tarkempaa jaottelua, esim. luennot tummanpunaisella, harjoitukset vaaleanpunaisella jne."
    so is this voluntery?
- About the grading: I want the grade 3, and i currently have almost everything for the easy project
    so should i do a good easy project (3) vs a bad intermediate project (2) :D
