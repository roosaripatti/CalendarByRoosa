Progress log:

9.4.2024

Most significant changes made since the last meeting:
- Weekly view of GUI is almost done even though it still doesn't do anything
- "resources" folder added for pictures, fonts etc.

Most significant issues currently:
- No issues risen yet

Time spent on the project so far:
- Maybe 10 hours

What next?
- File reader
- Using and showing current date and time in calendar

Questions
- For design purposes I'm planning to just list the events on the weekly view (no hours shown), 
and the daily view would show the events hour by hour. Is this ok?
